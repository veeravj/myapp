    <p1> A 24-year-old boy seeing out from the train’s window shouted, “Dad, look the trees are going behind!”<br>

        Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24-year old’s childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed, “Dad, look the clouds are running with us!”<br>
        
        The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old ma, “Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?” The old man smiled and said, “I did and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.</p1><br>

    <h1>Moral of the Story:</h1>
    <p2>Sometimes we make a judgment too quickly not realizing that people act in certain situations because they are going through something. Every single person in the world has his or her own battles to face. Don’t judge too harshly. Instead, be kind and try to understand where a person is coming from.</p2>
